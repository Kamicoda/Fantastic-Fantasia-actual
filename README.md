Fnatasstic fantasia README

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project  

this project is a promotional website for a digital product from a populer game
the gam ein question is Square enix's Final Fantasy 14 and the product is an ingame potion bought with real money
that alters the appearence of your charecter

UX

this website was created to guide new players on how to go about buying and using a fantasia potion as this question occasionaly pops up
i thought it would be a good idea to create a guide website to point people in the right direction

due to an ever increasing workload at my current workplace ive been awake very few hours around work so i had to design this
website as simply and easy as i posibly could while adding as much content that i can in my given timeframe (im writing this now knowing full well i start work in 4hours)

Simple Nav bar with just a tittle and a hamburger drop down followed by Bootstraps jumpotrons with content inside all except the gallery pages
and the footer was a simple bootstrap snip from my mini resume project witch a bit of tinkering in CSS

Features

this website starts with a simple landing page and sales pitch
. a gallery with buttons either side to flick through the various imiges ( Provided by my Freecompany members *Melanie and emily/yisu)
. a info page to describe the product in more details
. a How to guide comprised of a row of jumbotrons with imiges set into them and text discribing what to down

//planned but not implemented 
                              . a signup page with the elements bieng set in a jumbotron
                              . a news and recent articles which would have linked recent news from Squiare enix's twitter and facebook
                              


Tech

this project uses the obviouse HTML and CSS
with a few snippets of Java script thrown into the html files help and code snippets were from https://www.w3schools.com/
for the hamburger menu and DIV scrolling buttons in the gallery

Testing

As the design was so simple and time was short the testing was comprised of making sure all the links work as expected on a few diffrent screen sizes
